## Better AI conversion to local / nearby cultures & faiths

- Given reason, less likely to convert to their capital's foreign culture
- While losing a defensive war, less likely to convert to the attacker's faith
- Mechanic to track successful Crusades/Jihads/GHWs in order to allow robust testing of whether a given character should be allowed to assimilate local/nearby cultures and/or faiths dependent upon whether they are part of an intact Crusader state
  - Stops the nearly instantaneous conversion of Crusader states to local religion & culture
